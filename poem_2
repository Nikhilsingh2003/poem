Verse 1:
Every time I close my eyes
I see a world beyond the skies
A place where love and hope collide
Where dreams come true and hearts unite

Chorus:
I wanna live in that world, fly high
Where the sun shines bright, never goodbye
Where the stars twinkle and the moon glows
And the love in our hearts forever flows

Verse 2:
Let's take a journey, you and I
Through the mountains, the valleys, the sky
We'll explore the wonders of this place
And feel the magic in every space

Chorus:
We'll live in that world, fly high
Where the sun shines bright, never goodbye
Where the stars twinkle and the moon glows
And the love in our hearts forever flows

Bridge:
Life can be tough, but we'll stay strong
Together we'll make our way, never wrong
We'll face the challenges, the ups and downs
And we'll keep moving forward, in leaps and bounds

Chorus:
We'll live in that world, fly high
Where the sun shines bright, never goodbye
Where the stars twinkle and the moon glows
And the love in our hearts forever flows

Outro:
So let's hold hands and never let go
And live in that world, where love will grow
Our hearts will soar, and our souls will sing
And we'll be happy in everything.
