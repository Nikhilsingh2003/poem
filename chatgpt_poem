Verse 1:
Every night when I close my eyes
I see a world that's full of surprises
A place where I can be anything
And everything is just a new beginning

Chorus:
I'm dreaming, I'm flying
I'm reaching for the stars up high
I'm hoping, I'm trying
To make my dreams come to life

Verse 2:
In this world, there are no limits
And I can be whoever I want to be in it
I can be a hero or a queen
I can do anything, it's just a dream

Chorus:
I'm dreaming, I'm flying
I'm reaching for the stars up high
I'm hoping, I'm trying
To make my dreams come to life

Bridge:
Sometimes I wake up and it's all gone
But I know my dreams will never be wrong
I'll keep reaching and I'll keep trying
Until my dreams become a reality, no lying

Chorus:
I'm dreaming, I'm flying
I'm reaching for the stars up high
I'm hoping, I'm trying
To make my dreams come to life

Outro:
So if you have a dream, just hold on tight
And one day it will come to life
Keep dreaming, keep reaching
And soon you'll be flying!
